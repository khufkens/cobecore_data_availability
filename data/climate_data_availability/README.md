# README

The climate data availability gives an overview of the available climate data as digitized during the COBECORE project.

For each inventory piece in the State Archives we have made a file in excel, using the same number code as that in the inventory I 546 by Coppieters.

Folders with no data are empty. Data to be finished is marked with TD in the "unfinished" folder. (Reasons for TD are for example: large sheets that need to be rotated)
